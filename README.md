### [Facial Image Recognition App](https://smart-brain-dpn.herokuapp.com/)

_This project is from a Udemy course called [The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/), which teaches you how to become a full stack web developer._


#### Project Guidelines

The aim for this project is to build a facial image recognition web app using the latest technology trends. 
To complete the project, the below **user stories** needed to be fulfilled:
- I can can upload an image, click on a button and have the faces (if any are found) detected with a square box
- I am able to register
- I am able to login and logout
- There is an image upload counter that tells each user the total number of image uploads that they have done
- The page UI is different when the user is logged in


#### Project Approach

For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using React, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This involved creating the signin, register and the home (logged in) screens. 

The next part was creating the backend of this project using node.js and ensuring that the GET, POST and PUT requests would properly function handling the API calls, as well as handling the data. Later on, the data would be connected to a database.

The last part of the web app was to build a relational database using PostgreSQL to retrieve, store and update each user's data. All these aspects were connected together and tested to ensure each part works.

The app was fully deployed to Heroku.
