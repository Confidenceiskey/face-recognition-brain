# Facial Image Recognition App (**In progress**)

_This project is from a Udemy course called [The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/), which teaches you how to become a full stack web developer._


#### Project Guidelines

The aim for this project is to build a facial image recognition web app using the latest technology trends. 
To complete the project, the below **user stories** needed to be fulfilled:
- I can can upload an image, click on a button and have the faces (if any are found) detected with a square box
- I am able to register
- I am able to login and logout
- There is a ranking system in place that ranks each user depending on the number of image uploads that they have done
- The page UI is different when the user is logged in

I have completed most of the front end for the image recognition app and am currently working on the back end. I will update this when I have completed the project.
